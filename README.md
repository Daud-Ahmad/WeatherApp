🌦️ Weather Practice App – Modern Android Development with MVVM, Hilt & Coroutines
This is a Weather Practice App built with the goal of applying the latest Android development practices, architecture components, and tools. The main purpose of this repository is to demonstrate clean architecture, modular design, and modern best practices in a real-world app using Kotlin.

📌 Purpose
The primary objective of this project is to:

Implement modern Android development principles.

Use Jetpack libraries to create scalable, maintainable code.

Follow MVVM architecture for separation of concerns and testability.

Utilize Hilt for dependency injection to reduce boilerplate.

Integrate Kotlin Coroutines for efficient and clean asynchronous programming.
